                <h1>MIGDELINA BUELNA</h1> 
            <Divider />
            <p>Hello, there! My name is Migdelina, and I am a multifaceted individual with a diverse range of work experiences. Throughout my career, I have gained valuable skills in hospitality, sales, customer service, and most notably, six years of experience in the healthcare industry. However, I recently made an exciting decision to pursue my passion for technology and enrolled in school to major in computer science.</p>
            <p>To further enhance my technical expertise, I completed a rigorous 12-week full stack software engineering immersive program with General Assembly. This intensive program has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development, and I am eager to apply my knowledge to real-world projects. One aspect of software development that particularly resonates with me is the opportunity to leverage my artistic eye and passion for art and visuals to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.</p>
            <p>When I'm not immersed in coding, I find joy in nurturing my indoor plant collection. Gardening has become a beloved hobby of mine, allowing me to connect with nature and create a tranquil environment. In addition, I share my home with two cats and two dogs, who bring immense joy and companionship to my life.</p>
            <p>Exploring the great outdoors is another passion of mine. Whether it's roller skating, hiking in picturesque landscapes, or embarking on exciting travel adventures, I thrive on the thrill of new experiences and the beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>As a native Spanish speaker, having been born in Mexico, I bring a multicultural perspective to my interactions and value diversity in all aspects of life. Growing up in California has shaped my outlook on the world, fostering a blend of diverse influences and a deep appreciation for cultural exchange.</p>
            <p>I am excited about the prospect of combining my diverse background, passion for technology, and artistic flair to make meaningful contributions in the field of software development. I look forward to new opportunities, collaborations, and the chance to continue growing both personally and professionally.</p>
